**The Bear Conservation Counter, or BEARAI, is a program that detects the presence of black or brown bears in an image through the Jetson Resnet-18 Network.**


**The Purpose:**
To aid nature organizations with conservation of black and brown bears, by collecting and keeping an accurate database of black/brown bears from a surveillance camera. 



**Directions:**
With your Jetson Nano, please upload the bearAI script into your jetson-inference. With the resnet-18 network setup with the bearAI code, load your desired image within network and get an image classification. This image classifcation is stored into a dictionary database that can be accessed via the database_print code. 


**Resnet 18:**
Resnet-18 is a machine learning framework from PyTorch that can be utilized to detect items from images, and be classified into different classes.
